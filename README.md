# BusAnimation

### Description
This code creates a map using Mapbox API and displays a button. When the button is clicked, it animates a marker on the map along a predefined set of coordinates representing bus stops. The animation is achieved through a recursive function that uses a timeout to update the marker's position every second.

### How to Run

After acquiring the files you will then have to input your own API Token in order to load a map. Once that you have been able to load the map There will be a button on the top left if you press the button it will then do as described.

### Roadmap of Future Improvements
I plan to create a live update feed of the Bus Tracker. Go even further as to track a few more Buses. Other possible improvements will be to have Trains or subways to the live feed.
